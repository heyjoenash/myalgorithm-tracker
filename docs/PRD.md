# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## MyAlgorithm - The Open Source Social Feed Platform

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Vision
Build the world's first user-controlled algorithm platform where anyone can create, customize, and share their own real-time data trackers - giving users ownership over their information diet.

### Problem Statement
- **Users are trapped** by opaque social media algorithms they can't control
- **Information discovery** is fragmented across dozens of platforms
- **Static reports** (mood boards, trend reports) are outdated instantly
- **No ownership** of personal curation and discovery methods

### Solution
A platform that enables users to:
1. **Create custom trackers** in plain English (60 seconds)
2. **Get daily updated feeds** with rich media content
3. **Share and follow** other users' algorithms
4. **Own their data** and export their trackers

**Name:** Sarah, 28, Digital Marketing Manager

### Secondary Persona: The Enthusiast
**Name:** Mike, 35, Hobby Collector

- **Goal:** Never miss relevant items in his niche

### Tertiary Persona: The Professional

## 3. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Epic 1: Tracker Creation
**As a user, I want to create trackers using natural language so I can start tracking without technical knowledge.**

#### User Story 1.1: Natural Language Input
```gherkin
Given I am on the tracker builder page
When I type "Track Korean beauty trends from TikTok"
Then I should see a preview of results within 30 seconds
And the results should include images and videos
And I should be able to save the tracker
```

#### User Story 1.2: Template Selection
```gherkin
Given I want to create a tracker quickly
When I click on a template like "Tech News"
Then the builder should pre-fill with relevant settings
And I should be able to customize before saving
```

### Epic 2: Content Consumption
**As a user, I want to view my trackers in a beautiful feed so I can quickly consume information.**

#### User Story 2.1: Feed Display
```gherkin
Given I have active trackers
When I visit my dashboard
Then I should see a grid of media-rich cards
And each card should show the latest updates
And I should be able to filter by tracker
```

#### User Story 2.2: Detail View
```gherkin
Given I want more information about a result
When I click on a card
Then I should see expanded details
And related items
And sharing options
```

### Epic 3: Social Features
**As a user, I want to discover and share trackers so I can build a community.**

#### User Story 3.1: Discover Trackers
```gherkin
Given I want to find new trackers
When I browse the explore page
Then I should see trending trackers
And categories to browse
And user recommendations
```

#### User Story 3.2: Share Trackers
```gherkin
Given I created an awesome tracker
When I click share
Then I should get a beautiful preview card
And one-click sharing to social media
And a shareable link
```
